            <div class="section-text align-center mbr-white mbr-fonts-style display-5"><div>The Hunter Stronghold, Sten Njal. Taken by Deaths Hunters, a team led by the leader Scorch. The plan had been thought out, a five man team, infiltrating the base, lowering the defenses and allowing reinforcements to enter with ease. The plan went smoothly. Until the UNSC defenses were alerted by a mishap of the Hunters, they were being played. Two Spartan III’s had been tracking them, and took advantage of the delicate operation to attack them. Alarms were triggered and within a minute the five man group was surrounded and out gunned.</div><br><div>
</div><div>Being forced to surrender. But no Hunter surrenders. When the UNSC marines approached them, Scorch’s honor guard lurched our, grabbing them, and throwing them at other marines and opening fire, the two close quarters Hunters equipped their shotguns and focused on lowering the gates, while Scorch dealt with the Spartans. Engaging in a fist fight, taking small arms fire from marines, until a shot rang out from outside the base, one Spartan dropped dead. The other ran for cover. Griffen, the sniper of the Hunters had came in time to assist. She took aim at surrounding marines and dropped them with her secondary. Out of the shadows dropped another Hunter, this one equipped with knifes and handguns. He dropped behind the Spartan, throwing him into a wall, they engaged in a fight, exchanging hits. This Hunter was faster, he hit the Spartan in the ribs, a audible crack rang out. Fighting around stopped, as the fight carried on, marines gathered around, some ran. The Hunter grabbed a knife going to kill the Spartan, he jabbed and the Spartan grabbed his wrist and moved it away. Grazing his armour. A shot rang out, stopping the fight and making everyone flinch. Scorch approached the two and gave the order for his Assassin to back off. He did. Scorch looked at the Spartan. And said one word. “Leave”. The Spartan looked around, and saw more Hunters gathering around. Some in the shadows others on ledges, some just in the open with all sorts of weapons ready to finish a fight already won. He Spartan gave his comrades the order to retreat and they did. He lifted his fallen Spartan and left. A few hunters attempted to follow. But Scorch refused it and had them hold. The battle was over, the Stronghold that had been a death trap for centuries lost within a night to a group of masked individuals skilled in areas that no others were. Sten Njal was the Hunters new home base, a place to relax and feel at home. Or so they thought.</div><br><div>
</div><div>Within the coming months, wars broke out. Battles started and the Hunters of Death were brought into battle each time, losing brothers in arms, never giving up. Until the day they were finally overrun. Taken by surprise by an UNSC and Sanghelli invasion. The two forces allying together to attack the Hunters. Out numbered and out gunned. Scorch, decided to evacuate the base for once and for all. But the Pelicans needed time to load supplies and fuel. They’d have to defend Sten Njal once and for all. Drop ships came down, UNSC pelicans and phantoms dropping off endless supplies of weaponry and soldiers. And then, a custom pelican came in. Landing in the back, hidden by dust and sand. It dropped off ODST’s. Carrying large turrets. And then, out of the dust came the Spartan III from all those years ago.</div><br><div>
</div><div>He had customized his armor, skulls covering his chest and arms. His armor was pitch black. He pulled a shotgun from his back, pointing a hand at his men, and then gave the order for them to charge the Stronghold. Scorch was ahead of him though, he’d set mines and had mortars ready. The second the soldiers left the beach, all hell broke loose, infantry groups being ripped apart by shrapnel and vehicles being crushed by mortars. Griffen, taking her group to a ledge to sniper from. Dropping whole groups with single mags. One of her men took aim at a ODST, but was instantly shot down, grasping for he ledge as he fell, missing. Griffen made a grab for his arm, grabbing his hand, looking as he was hundred feet above the ground about to fall, she started to lift him, until, the Spartan grabbed a rifle taking aim Griffen, and pulled the trigger. The soldier lifted himself up in time to move in front of the bullet. His eyes looking up at her, as he fell. Everyone stopped, each Hunter. Watching as his lifeless body fell, dropping to the ground to a heap. She took aim at the Spartan. Pulling the trigger, he threw a passing elite into the crossfire and used it as a body shield. Pushing forward into cover. Scorch with a single wave, gave a order that’d change the tide of the battle. With the wave of his hand, trained and skilled in areas of stealth. Assassins dropped on top of the ODST’s and Spartan. Instantly killing two ODST’s driving their knifes into their skulls. One went for the Spartan, but was instantly stopped, when he went to stab him, but the Spartan was faster, and grabbed him by the throat, crushing it instantly his body becoming rigid. The other assassins rushed him but were intercepted by the ODST’s.</div><br><div>
</div><div>The battle raged on. One of the three Pelicans was ready to launch. Scorch ordered the injured out first on it. The were loaded onto it and were ready to leave, he gave the all clear. The pelican began to leave he base when two heavy ODST’s took aim and without hesitation, shot two rockets at the engines, watching as it sprawled out of control into the cliff side, exploding on impact, screams echoing throughout the battle field. Some honor guard staggered backwards, in horror as their comrades tried to jump from the burning pelican only to fall to their deaths, Scorch then, grabbing his shotgun. Jumped into the fray. The Honor guard following close behind, being covered by the snipers, scorch spotted the Spartan he let go all those years ago. And with one breath said “For my brethren” and charged, throwing marines out of his way, the honor guard in pursuit to keep up. The Spartan saw them, and in response gave the order with a yell, “TO THE HOLD” and the forces clashed, ODST’s and honor guard both of equal match clashing hand to hand, knife to knife, the Spartan saw scorch busy with a ODST, and grabbed his neck, ready to snap it, squeezing harder Scorch had started to blackout loosing his grip on his shotgun. Scorch with all his weight pushed backwards, grabbing his knife and driving it into the Spartans thigh, breaking free and catching his breath. He took a good look at his adversary and charged one last time, knife equipped and a burning hatred for the UNSC he charged. The Spartan charged too, picking up a nearby energy sword, rushing faster, even with an injured leg.</div><br><div>
</div><div>He swung, missing Scorch’s head, but driving it into the blade of his knife, scorch staggered into a roll, falling on his back, the Spartan taking advantage of it pressed down on his wrist, Scorch cried out in pain as his left hand became useless, broken and snapped. The Spartan with a final word spoke out “I do this for her” and drove the sword down. The blade felt of melting nails being pushed into his chest, becoming solid and liquid at the same time. Scorch screamed in pain, as the life drained away. The Spartan was about to drive it further to finish him off, when the leader of the honor guard approached. Grabbing the Spartan by the back of his armor, and throwing him into a nearby rock wall. Demolishing it, he drew a sword, and rushed. The Spartan barely parrying. The leader of the guard started to name every Hunter that had died defending their home. Scorch, crawling away. Bleeding out, was approached by two other Honor guard and was dragged back to the Pelicans. Watching helplessly as two elites charged his friend. The Guard leader on the defense was over powered, stabbing one elite through the throat, beheading it. But the sword was done for, he went to his fist, swinging, and breaking the other elites neck, and looked at scorch, through his helmet Scorch knew he was smiling, and he started to walk to his injured leader, until a sword, drove through his chest, making him fall to his knees. Scorch with the only strength he had left, screamed out “Nooooooo” as his friend, looked into the blazing sun, and then his leaders eyes. And whisper “For the H-“ and was cut off by the sword, that had pierced his heart. Scorch watched as the sword retracted and the once smiling man, fell down as a corpse. Scorch, without any strength began to black out. Only seeing parts of the battle, he blacked out with his last view of scorpions being deployed alongside wraiths.</div><br><div>
</div><div>Killing groups of hunters as they ran, two ships remained in the base, Scorch gained consciousnesses inside on, to Bio-foam being injected to his wounds, he glanced over to see Griffen, holding his hand, and passed back out. Closing his eyes, and hearing the screams for mercy and help from his comrades he left behind. The ships lifted off, taking only a handful of the Hunters. The battle was lost.

It means invincible home in latin, it was the only stronghold to withstand a full on assault from the prophet of Truth's fleet. However when the insurrectionists decided to make an alliance with the covenant the stronghold couldn't withstand being attacked from in and out of it's walls.
<br><br><div>After the evacuation of Sten Njal the hunters have been travelling trying to find a new home. They stumbled upon Invicta Domum while they were fleeing from a UNSC Patrol unit while traversing through a series of canyons. They decided to hide in the ruins finding new supplies and ammo while hunkered down in the various hallways and rooms.
</div><br><div><br></div><div><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">Once the patrol left, the hunters decided to try and fix the stronghold and make a new base where the UNSC weren't likely to look. Though the patrol gave them a run for their money beings how they were last spotted there, the defenses were able to be rebuilt in time for the first wave of infantry.&nbsp;</span></div><br><div><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;"><br></span></div><div>The following months made not only the Hunters stronger but also their defences. The AA turrets were replaced, the defensive shields were fixed, and multiple training facilities were installed. Invicta Domum felt more like a home now than ever.
