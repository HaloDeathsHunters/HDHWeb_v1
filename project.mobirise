Taken by Deaths Hunters, a team led by the leader Scorch. The plan had been thought out, a five man team, infiltrating the base, lowering the defenses and allowing reinforcements to enter with ease. The plan went smoothly. Until the UNSC defenses were alerted by a mishap of the Hunters, they were being played. Two Spartan III’s had been tracking them, and took advantage of the delicate operation to attack them. Alarms were triggered and within a minute the five man group was surrounded and out gunned.</div><br><div>\n</div><div>Being forced to surrender. But no Hunter surrenders. When the UNSC marines approached them, Scorch’s honor guard lurched our, grabbing them, and throwing them at other marines and opening fire, the two close quarters Hunters equipped their shotguns and focused on lowering the gates, while Scorch dealt with the Spartans. Engaging in a fist fight, taking small arms fire from marines, until a shot rang out from outside the base, one Spartan dropped dead. The other ran for cover. Griffen, the sniper of the Hunters had came in time to assist. She took aim at surrounding marines and dropped them with her secondary. Out of the shadows dropped another Hunter, this one equipped with knifes and handguns. He dropped behind the Spartan, throwing him into a wall, they engaged in a fight, exchanging hits. This Hunter was faster, he hit the Spartan in the ribs, a audible crack rang out. Fighting around stopped, as the fight carried on, marines gathered around, some ran. The Hunter grabbed a knife going to kill the Spartan, he jabbed and the Spartan grabbed his wrist and moved it away. Grazing his armour. A shot rang out, stopping the fight and making everyone flinch. Scorch approached the two and gave the order for his Assassin to back off. He did. Scorch looked at the Spartan. And said one word. “Leave”. The Spartan looked around, and saw more Hunters gathering around. Some in the shadows others on ledges, some just in the open with all sorts of weapons ready to finish a fight already won. He Spartan gave his comrades the order to retreat and they did. He lifted his fallen Spartan and left. A few hunters attempted to follow. But Scorch refused it and had them hold. The battle was over, the Stronghold that had been a death trap for centuries lost within a night to a group of masked individuals skilled in areas that no others were. Sten Njal was the Hunters new home base, a place to relax and feel at home. Or so they thought.</div><br><div>\n</div><div>Within the coming months, wars broke out. Battles started and the Hunters of Death were brought into battle each time, losing brothers in arms, never giving up. Until the day they were finally overrun. Taken by surprise by an UNSC and Sanghelli invasion. The two forces allying together to attack the Hunters. Out numbered and out gunned. Scorch, decided to evacuate the base for once and for all. But the Pelicans needed time to load supplies and fuel. They’d have to defend Sten Njal once and for all. Drop ships came down, UNSC pelicans and phantoms dropping off endless supplies of weaponry and soldiers. And then, a custom pelican came in. Landing in the back, hidden by dust and sand. It dropped off ODST’s. Carrying large turrets. And then, out of the dust came the Spartan III from all those years ago.</div><br><div>\n</div><div>He had customized his armor, skulls covering his chest and arms. His armor was pitch black. He pulled a shotgun from his back, pointing a hand at his men, and then gave the order for them to charge the Stronghold. Scorch was ahead of him though, he’d set mines and had mortars ready. The second the soldiers left the beach, all hell broke loose, infantry groups being ripped apart by shrapnel and vehicles being crushed by mortars. Griffen, taking her group to a ledge to sniper from. Dropping whole groups with single mags. One of her men took aim at a ODST, but was instantly shot down, grasping for he ledge as he fell, missing. Griffen made a grab for his arm, grabbing his hand, looking as he was hundred feet above the ground about to fall, she started to lift him, until, the Spartan grabbed a rifle taking aim Griffen, and pulled the trigger. The soldier lifted himself up in time to move in front of the bullet. His eyes looking up at her, as he fell. Everyone stopped, each Hunter. Watching as his lifeless body fell, dropping to the ground to a heap. She took aim at the Spartan. Pulling the trigger, he threw a passing elite into the crossfire and used it as a body shield. Pushing forward into cover. Scorch with a single wave, gave a order that’d change the tide of the battle. With the wave of his hand, trained and skilled in areas of stealth. Assassins dropped on top of the ODST’s and Spartan. Instantly killing two ODST’s driving their knifes into their skulls. One went for the Spartan, but was instantly stopped, when he went to stab him, but the Spartan was faster, and grabbed him by the throat, crushing it instantly his body becoming rigid. The other assassins rushed him but were intercepted by the ODST’s.</div><br><div>\n</div><div>The battle raged on. One of the three Pelicans was ready to launch. Scorch ordered the injured out first on it. The were loaded onto it and were ready to leave, he gave the all clear. The pelican began to leave he base when two heavy ODST’s took aim and without hesitation, shot two rockets at the engines, watching as it sprawled out of control into the cliff side, exploding on impact, screams echoing throughout the battle field. Some honor guard staggered backwards, in horror as their comrades tried to jump from the burning pelican only to fall to their deaths, Scorch then, grabbing his shotgun. Jumped into the fray. The Honor guard following close behind, being covered by the snipers, scorch spotted the Spartan he let go all those years ago. And with one breath said “For my brethren” and charged, throwing marines out of his way, the honor guard in pursuit to keep up. The Spartan saw them, and in response gave the order with a yell, “TO THE HOLD” and the forces clashed, ODST’s and honor guard both of equal match clashing hand to hand, knife to knife, the Spartan saw scorch busy with a ODST, and grabbed his neck, ready to snap it, squeezing harder Scorch had started to blackout loosing his grip on his shotgun. Scorch with all his weight pushed backwards, grabbing his knife and driving it into the Spartans thigh, breaking free and catching his breath. He took a good look at his adversary and charged one last time, knife equipped and a burning hatred for the UNSC he charged. The Spartan charged too, picking up a nearby energy sword, rushing faster, even with an injured leg.</div><br><div>\n</div><div>He swung, missing Scorch’s head, but driving it into the blade of his knife, scorch staggered into a roll, falling on his back, the Spartan taking advantage of it pressed down on his wrist, Scorch cried out in pain as his left hand became useless, broken and snapped. The Spartan with a final word spoke out “I do this for her” and drove the sword down. The blade felt of melting nails being pushed into his chest, becoming solid and liquid at the same time. Scorch screamed in pain, as the life drained away. The Spartan was about to drive it further to finish him off, when the leader of the honor guard approached. Grabbing the Spartan by the back of his armor, and throwing him into a nearby rock wall. Demolishing it, he drew a sword, and rushed. The Spartan barely parrying. The leader of the guard started to name every Hunter that had died defending their home. Scorch, crawling away. Bleeding out, was approached by two other Honor guard and was dragged back to the Pelicans. Watching helplessly as two elites charged his friend. The Guard leader on the defense was over powered, stabbing one elite through the throat, beheading it. But the sword was done for, he went to his fist, swinging, and breaking the other elites neck, and looked at scorch, through his helmet Scorch knew he was smiling, and he started to walk to his injured leader, until a sword, drove through his chest, making him fall to his knees. Scorch with the only strength he had left, screamed out “Nooooooo” as his friend, looked into the blazing sun, and then his leaders eyes. And whisper “For the H-“ and was cut off by the sword, that had pierced his heart. Scorch watched as the sword retracted and the once smiling man, fell down as a corpse. Scorch, without any strength began to black out. Only seeing parts of the battle, he blacked out with his last view of scorpions being deployed alongside wraiths.</div><br><div>\n</div><div>Killing groups of hunters as they ran, two ships remained in the base, Scorch gained consciousnesses inside on, to Bio-foam being injected to his wounds, he glanced over to see Griffen, holding his hand, and passed back out. Closing his eyes, and hearing the screams for mercy and help from his comrades he left behind. The ships lifted off, taking only a handful of the Hunters. The battle was lost.\n</div><div><br></div></div>\n            <hr class=\"line\" mbr-style=\"{'width': lineLength + '%'}\">\n        </div>\n    </div>\n</section>",

Found by Scorch, leader of the Hunters. And trained by him. Excelling in every category. He’s saved his Hunters more times than anyone can count, being the best sniper at times, and the best with a shotgun. His skill doesn’t stop improving. He’s been trained in honorable fights, and loses only when he’s bored. A very strong soldier indeed. He’s been promoted to the Second Commanding Officer of the Hunters, carrying out orders, dishing them out. Doing what he believed would help the Hunters flourish. Stream is a very young member, but a place for him is in the Hunters, the day he is older and matured more. Will be the day he may even exceed into becoming a leader.

He is second, if not the best shot, when he’s focused. An ex marine marksman, working under the command of the Spirit of Fire. Training since day one of being able to hold a rifle, he was loyal to the UNSC until the faithful fight against Atriox. After seeing so many lives being thrown away, so many people killed, so many hurt. He made a final stand giving the injured a chance to get away. As he did, The Spirt of Fire pulled away. Leaving him, and the injured to Atriox’s wrath. They were executed one by one. Starting with the marines who did the most damage. They were put in pits and told to survive choppers as they sped toward them, none survived. Then the pilots, they were thrown off the sides of cliffs. Then tank crews, scorpions and grizzlys, kodiaks too. They were put together and bombarded by Wraith shells. Only few survived, those who did were sent away, Never seen again. Sky watched all of this in horror, until finally, the snipers were brought up. Being pulled in their shackles, punched and shocked as they marched to Atriox. Put to their knees. All of them were pushed down, but Sky refused to kneel. He stood his ground. And when a brute tried to push him down, he quickly made a grab for a knife he concealed and cut the brutes throat. Returning his burning gaze of hatred toward Atriox. Atriox just laughed and walked away. Getting aboard a troop transport. And all that was audible for Sky to hear was “-as you please-“ from Atriox.\n</div><br><div><br></div><div>Then the transport left and the brutes pulled out their hammers, the elites ignited the energy swords. And the grunts grabbed plasma grenades ready to chuck them at the men before them. And as the brute, who had been cut down by Sky, Got up ,blood slowly oozing down his throat, Pulled out his own hammer and started for Sky. As he looked up into the cool blue sky, he spotted something, a ship or maybe two. Coming down, quickly. Breaking the atmosphere and as he heard the sonic boom. He also heard the order “Kill” from a brute. And then the men surrounding him were bashed to nothing, stabbed and pierced screaming and begging for mercy. The hammers left nothing but blood and bone, smashed to nothing. Sky tried to stand to stop one, attempting to save the guy next to him, but was stopped by the brute he injured. He was put into a head lock, Forced to watch. But as the hammer started going down onto his fellow snipers, there was another boom, then two large explosions around them. Brutes flew through the air and grunts exploded with their grenades. Sky took advantage of this and slipped from the grip of the brute holding him and ran for a weapon, anything, but he couldn’t find a single weapon he could use. And then more explosions, one landed near him, propelling him into the air and against a tree. Barely conscious he looked up to see three figures jump from one of the two ships, which he could tell were pelicans now that they were closer.</div><br><div>The figures landed with ease, \n</div><div>Crushing a brute another crushing two elites and the the last one, squashing a whole squad of grunts. He had gained his bearing and could overhear them. “does he always have to make a ‘Grand Entrance’” from the one on the left. “Just let him have some fun.” Front he one on the right, they sounded female. And then from the other one, “Let’s have some fun now.” He pulled out a sword, Sky had just put it together, that one was a Sangllie. The other two were Spartans. The leader he assumed finally spoke yelling to get his voice over the shock of the brutes barking orders “I’ll give you one chance to surrender and you’ll be spared. Live to fight another day.” The brutes laughed together. The one Sky has injured came from the horde and spoke “He’s mine” and the elite that had landed rushed forward with his sword and stabbed the brute through the throat and causally walked back to his place, as the brutes head slide from his body. The rest roared and charged. It didn’t take long and Sky watched every bit. The brutes were killed with easy, the two Spartans. The one who was female pulled a large rifle from her back and jumped to a large branch on a tree.\n</div><div>And shot every brute she could. Shooting round after round faster than any rifle he’s ever seen. The leader, with the support of his Elite took on about twenty at a time. The leader suddenly broke from fighting and charged at a wraith. The brutes were confused by that, so was Sky. It was just suicidal. But he kept running. And as a the wraith shot, the Spartan kept running until the shell was on top of him, then jumped over it. Using the explosion to push himself on to the wraith and placed a bomb on it. He repeated this until they were all gone. And when Sky glanced back to the elite the last brute was being killed. And then a chopper sped past Sky, making him jump and cough from the fumes and dirt. The chopper kept going, the brute yelling “YOU’RE DOO-“ and then he cut off as the rifle the female Spartan had been using fired. The brute fell from his chopper in a heap while the chopper kept going crashing into a wall. With that, the female jumped down. Ordering the elite to search for survivors, she approached sky, she then gave him a rebreather.</div><br><div>\n</div><div>He took it and it helped him breathe a bit. “Air isn’t safe for us humans, too toxic from the smog of these filthy vehicles. The leader approached the Elite and they spoke, he was only able to catch “-none” with the elite shaking his head. The leader looked down, and punched it. Creating a small creator. The female called him over “Scorch, we’ve got one”. He glanced up, Sky could see his armor, it had aface carved in his visor, a Forerunner face, it made him jump at first. Scorch approached them, the Elite following close. “I’m sorry we were late. I truly am. You’re the sole survivor of this. I would of been here sooner, but we got caught in a fight with some ships in space and were only able to send two pelicans.” Sky just starred. </div><br><div>“What happened? How did it come to this?” Asked the female.\n</div><div>“Griffen, not now. It’s too soo-“ Sky spoke quietly but clearly. “we, were abandoned by the UNSC, left to Atriox.” Hearing that, Scorch walked to a tree a few meters away, and punched it. Tearing to down. “The UNSC are cowards, I told you guys this over and over. They can’t be helped. We’re ending them.” Before the others could say a word, Sky jumped in. “I want in”. Griffen, and the elite both looked at Scorch. He lent a hand down to Sky. And lifted him up. “We’re Deaths Hunters. Not the average mercenaries you tend to find. We get the job done. Think you can handle that?” Sky spoke clearly and louder this time. “Just give me a rifle and the jobs done.\" With that, they went to the Pelicans and took off. </div><br><div>This was the beginning of a great change of fate for the Hunters.\n</div><div><br></div></div>\n            <hr class=\"line\" mbr-style=\"{'width': lineLength + '%'}\">\n        </div>\n    </div>\n</section>",

He grew up on the move, his father was a miner, His mother, she was killed in a fight between Insurrectionist and the UNSC, shot down by a Marine. After that day, he’d always seen the UNSC as his enemy. When he was fifteen, he joined the insurgents and started using grenades and dynamite. He was able to experiment and find out what made what work in a bomb. </div><br><div>By the age of sixteen, he was working in missions.</div><div>His first was when he was tasked on taking out a bridge to stop the UNSC from shipping troops to a nearby town, he placed the explosives on the supports of the bridge and once everything was set he got into a position to see the convoy. “Dunc, they’re closing in. Bombs better be ready. Because they’re bringing scorpions”radioed in his squad leader. “Get ready for the show” he replied. He waited another five minutes and saw it. Twenty warthogs with three trucks carrying scorpions onboard. “Hey, Boss. What if I blow the bridge after the tanks are across. That leaves ten hogs and three battle ready tanks for us.” He said said after seeing how spread they were. “I don’t like it, we don’t have enough to deal with that.” Was the response he got. “But-“ he protested. “No.” The convoy was almost to the bridge “sorry boss, but we need these” and he unhooked his comm. “Get ready to take out those hogs, we’re taking those for ourselves!” He yelled to his men. The hogs started crossing with the tanks close behind on the trucks. He clicked the safety of and moved his thumb over the detonator. “Fuck the UNSC.” \n<span style=\"font-size: 1.5rem;\">And clicked the button.</span></div><br><div>It exploded sending the bridge down, with the hogs on it. The trucks barely made it. The hogs got into a defensive semi circle and started readying their turrets. “Now” he whispered. Two rockets were fired at hogs and they instantly exploded and shots began ringing out. “CHARGE” He yelled grabbing his grenade launcher from a near rock and immobilized a hog. After ten minutes of fighting the UNSC surrendered. “Cuff them and set them in a line” he ordered. After that, he began making a name for himself. Ten years later, he was working on a whole new mission. Except  this one would change everything. He was mid mission. He rigged a few rockets together and set them in place near a door. “Get back” he said shooting it. It exploded into a beautiful flame of blue then red. And the door was gone exposing the exit, “Alright, move!”.\n</div><div><br></div><div>He pushed through taking cover behind whatever he could, under fire from AP rounds of a Wasp, and an impact .50 cal sniper. He watched as limbs were blown off of his men, most of crimson blood evaporated. People being littered with bullets, “FOCUS ON THAT SNIPER, THAT WASP IS MINE” he said rushing out, grabbing a dead UNSC soldiers body, using it as a body shield, and shot off a grenade from the grenade launcher he carried. It exploded and the wasp lost control spinning out of the air into a tower, falling across a open field. “Shit” was all he said before he was under fire from the Sniper. “GET HIM OFF ME, WE GOT THIS” he said rushing toward the wasp, the pilot trying to recalibrate the controls to work. Dunc pulled out a magnum and shot through the visor the pilot slumping over into a heap. He moved the pilot and took control. “Guys, divert his fire. I got a really, stupid idea”. Two troops moved to the sight of the sniper, shooting at him suppressing him. Dunc took off veering out of sight, staying low. “Dunc, we cant do this for-“ a shot rang out and the comm went quiet. He looked out to look for the soldier, but was only able to see a body with a hole in his stomach. “Oh he’s gonna regret that.” He said to himself. He locked his weapons on the sniper, suddenly a Rocket Lock on alert blazed red and he took off avoiding the hit. The sniper spotted him and fired at the right engine, making the wasp spin out. “Ah fuck it!” he screamed. He spiraled into the bases roof, near the landing pad and jumped out before the wasp blew up.\n</div><div>He took out his grenade launcher, and took aim as hostiles came rushing toward him. He fired shot after shot and took out as many as he could, before taking a shot to his side. “Damn it!” he said as he dropped the grenade launcher which was now out of ammo. He pulled out his magnum and got headshot after headshot, UNSC bodies dropping like flies. Then his magnum clicked, signifying he was out of ammo. He pulled out his knife, not bothering to get a AR. For it’d be useless at close quarters, and went down the entrance the UNSC had used, lights flicked bright white as he scaled the stairs inside the base. He ended up on the level the sniper was, with a hallway leading to his position. “This isn’t gonna-“ he was cut off by a shot zooming past his head exploding the wall behind him. He jumped to the side and took cover “YOU’RE REALLY JUST A DICKHEAD AREN’T YOU!” He said.\n</div><div>A shot breaking some of the wall. ‘One’ he thought to himself, and jumped out ducking across the hall behind more cover, another shot hitting the floor, sending debris into his mouth. ‘Two’. He peaked and hid his face again. A shot hitting the wall, chunks hitting his mouth. ‘Three.’ He went for it, running as fast as he could, he saw the sniper, less than twenty feet, he ran. Knife out, he waited. And saw the snipers finger pull slowly on the trigger, and ran right for him. As he saw the finger go halfway down on the trigger. He slid to his knees dropping his body back in a slide and the sniper shot, going just above his face. The heat radiating off the round, he jumped up from his slide and plowed his knife into the throat of the Sniper. “Four.” And that’s for my guys. The sniper sputtered put blood before dropping dead.\n</div><div>His comm chirped and he pressed a button on it, “I have been watching you my friend. And you’re skilled. But not skilled enough to take on five Pelicans inbound on your position. I am a Hunter. I’m willing to help you, I’m dropping from a pelican now. I’m sorry about your friends, but you’re all that’s left. They all ran away, you were betrayed. Those that were loyal. Were shot to slow down the UNSC.” Dunc didn’t know what to address first. “who were they.” Was all he could say. “Guys in white and golden colors. All I know, is they shot people in the legs and stomach and left them for dead. And left. I’m willing to help you, my name is Scorch. I’m here to do all I can, I need to know you’ll cooperate.” Dunc picked up the rifle, and snapped it in half. “I’m done with the UNSC, I’m done with Insurrectionist, I cooperate, you let me join. Clear?” The person on the other end chuckled. You made my day a little brighter. And with that, every UNSC soldier that entered that base, signed their own death wish, Hunted until the end.\n</div><div><br></div></div>\n            <hr class=\"line\" mbr-style=\"{'width': lineLength + '%'}\">\n        </div>\n    </div>\n</section>",

Weeks have passed since he left the insurrection but he can remember how it happened like it was yesterday.\n</div><div><br></div><div>There were countless hostiles entering the courtyard ranging from Spartan IIIs to marines, the UNSC sent the biggest assault force available to destroy the insurrectionist stronghold. Electric was put in charge of the elite marksmen leading them up a cliff face getting a better vantage point of the battle. Once at the top of the cliff Electric set his bipod on the edge taking aim at one of the spartans and his squad. He unloaded his clip taking down the spartan and 3 of the marines. The final marine seeing his comrades drop before him instinctively drops his rifle and rolls to the ground just to be met with a fellow sniper round.\n</div><div>The battle seemed to be going in the defenders favor until a squad of heavy ODSTs broke down the main defensive gate leading into the rest of the base. It was during the explosion that multiple snipers were blinded and killed by hostile spartan. Before long, the base's defences were overrun causing the rest of the insurrectionists to either surrender or be killed.\n</div><div><br></div><div>Electric looked around him only to find bodies both dead and alive crawls up in balls crying for their comrades. He scavenges some ammo and runs away from the base, taking advantage of the UNSC being distracted as well as his comrades being to busy worrying about their own fate.\n</div><div>&nbsp;\n</div><br><div><br></div><div>Electric, now hundreds of klicks away from the stronghold, hears gunfire coming from a nearby canyon. He slowly makes his way towards the cliff taking out his rifle and loading a fresh mag along the way. Once he reaches the ledge he sees dozens UNSC dropships converging on a base that seemed to be in ruins. He looks down his scope surveying the structure, he notices a group of what seems to be mercenaries hunkered down in the rubble.\n</div><div>A loud explosion erupts from a few dropships after the A.A. turrets fire a barrage. The remaining dropships turn into a seperate path to get in cover from the turrets, this gives Electric time to set up his rifle and radio to try and pick up any hostile messages.\n</div><div><br></div><div>The first wave to leave the cover of the second passage was composed of marines and ODSTs. They were met by artillery fire along with heavy machine guns. The next few waves consisted of marines and warthogs. Then without any warning the rest of the attack force push out of the passageway attempting to surround the mercenary stronghold.\n</div><div><br></div><div>Electric watching the huge group push closer and closer to base decided now was as good a time as any to start firing. He unloaded multiple clips into the heard of ODSTs that seemed to be protecting something, he wanted to see what it was. Once the defenses noticed the same thing and provided covering fire onto the same group a fireteam of four spartan IIIs fled the group hunkering down behind large boulders.</div><br><div>Electric's heart starts beating faster and faster as he sees the same spartan that killed his fellow comrades weeks ago. He forces his heartbeat to calm down, taking aim at the spartan. He pulls the trigger hitting the spartan's pelvis causing him to collapse. The nearest spartan jumps on instinct turing and firing in the direction he thought the shot came from, however the spartan misjudged and was met with a sniper round through the skull. The other two, however, were not so unlucky and started to suppress Electric. He was then forced to back up a few feet before he was shot.\n</div><div><br></div><div>The leader of the mercenaries, seeing a non-hostile sniper being pinned down by the spartans, waves his hand giving the signal for a couple of rockets to fire upon the position of the spartans. The rockets seem to take an eternity to reach their mark, but once they do shrapnel and rock is flung into the air forcing the spartans to retreat further into the canyon. Electric takes this time to reload his sniper and try and reach to find a secure channel to contact the mercenaries but is unsuccessful.\n</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; Electric then resumes his previous position with his rifle trying to take out as many targets as possible that were getting close to the base. After releasing a couple mags he decided to scan the surrounding area to see where the spartans were hiding. He saw them retreating to what appeared to be a cave, he took aim at the spartan in front and shot him in the left leg forcing him to the ground rolling head-long into a rock. The second spartan seeing his friend fall decided to keep running toward the cave.\n</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; Once he reached the cave entrance he turned around to see if his fallen comrade had gotten up. Once he spotted his friend on the ground unconscious, he ran back to carry his friend into the cave. The mercenary leader saw this and ordered a series of rockets to be shot at the cave entrance.\n</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;Time seemed to go in slow-motion as the rockets exploded causing and rockslide that covered the entrance, also engulfing multiple Scorpion tanks and warthogs. The spartan, previously running towards his comrade, stops and turns to see the last of the barrage hitting the rock wall. He then turns around to see an assassin 2 feet away with his sword drawn.\n</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;The spartan makes the first move stepping forward with his left foot hooking his right arm. The assassin was fast, stepping to his right and kicking out the spartan's leg causing him to fall. Before the assassin could finish the job the spartan got to his feet jabbing at the assassins throat just missing the jugular vein. The assassin staggers backwards dropping his sword whilst trying to catch his breath. The spartan grabs the sword and rushes the breathless man.\n</div><div><br></div><div>Just before Electric could pull the trigger he heard a sniper shot come from directly to his right. He jumps up drawing his magnum, he sees a group of snipers climbing the cliff face lead by the person that must have shot the spartan beings how she was reloading her sniper. The leader held up her hand indicating she was friendly.\n</div><div><br></div><div>Electric goes back to the ledge to check what happened to the assassin and the spartan. He sees the assassin standing over the body of a spartan, the spartan has a bullet hole through the middle of the visor. Electric turns to the new sniper and says \"Nice shot.\" \"Thanks\" she says, \"I try.\" Electric then turns back to the valley seeing the remaining UNSC Soldiers retreating back to the dropships they came from.\n</div><div><br></div><div>After scaling down the cliff side with the mercenary snipers, Electric walks towards the first spartan he shot. He notices the spartan took its helmet off revealing it to be a female. Electric proceeds to walk up to the spartan not in the least bit worried about what she could do. He draws his magnum putting his rifle on his back, crouches next to the spartan, and says \"The insurrectionists at Tutoria Loca send their regards.\" He puts the gun to her head and pulls the trigger.\n</div><div><br></div><div>Electric then walks over to the unconscious spartan reloading his magnum. Once he gets close he notices how his armor is different from the rest having skulls on his chest with pitch black armor. He then lifts his magnum ready to pull the trigger, but before he does he hears \"Wait! This one's mine\" from behind him. He turns to see the leader of the group walking behind him flanked by the women he met on the cliff along with the assassin that went against the spartan. Electric reluctantly lowers his weapon and steps away.\n</div><div>The leader proceeds to the unconscious body and kicks it in the leg where Electric shot him, causing him to jump in pain. The leader dropped a knife a foot in front of the spartan and backed away another 5 foot drawing another knife. The spartan quickly realized what was happening and got up and grabbed the knife.\n</div><div><br></div><div>The spartan made the first move stepping with his left leg stabbing with his right arm. Before he could finish the movie the Mercenary grabbed his arm while kicking out his legs forcing him to fall. He let go of his arm and backed up allowing the spartan to get up. This time the merc. made the first move stepping to his left then lunging toward the spartan punching him in the chest. The spartan staggered back a step then stepped forward again going for an uppercut to the jaw but was to no avail. The mercenary sidestepped kneeing the spartan in the gut causing him to bend over, this allowed him to kick the spartan in the face making him fly into the air and land on his back.\n</div><div><br></div><div>The spartan, getting angry now, jumped to his feet and raced towards his opponent. he managed to land a few small punches but nothing to do much damage. The leader then spun around the spartan, kicking out his knees forcing him into a crouch position while placing a knife against his neck. He then started to walk to the spartans front with the knife still on the spartan's neck. He then started to name off every single person that died during the battle of 'Sten Njal', he then looked at the twilight sky, then back to the spartan and said \"This is for the Hunters!\" while thrusting the knife into the spartans heart.\n</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;He tore the knife from the dying spartan's body then turned to face the woman that was standing behind him, \"how many did we lose today?\" he asked. \"10 were killed and 20 others were injured.\" she said in turn. He sighed and turned to Electric, \"It's good to see we aren't the only ones that hate the UNSC... My name is Scorch.\" he then held out his hand. Electric shakes his hand and says, </div><div>\"My names Electric, I didn't know there was anyone out this far let alone a group of mercenaries.\" </div><div>\"We fled here after our old home was destroyed, we are Death's Hunters. This is Griffen, our lead marksman\" as he points toward the woman, \"And this is sky, our lead assassin.\" he then points to the assassin.<span style=\"font-size: 1.5rem;\">\"We welcome anyone that doesn't do us wrong, if you like we can provide a family and home.\"</span></div><div>\"I will gladly accept.\" Electric says eagerly.\n</div><div><br></div></div>\n            <hr class=\"line\" mbr-style=\"{'width': lineLength + '%'}\">\n        </div>\n    </div>\n</section>",

He spent his time, while not on scouting missions, honing his skills as a marksman and teaching his fellow sangheili how to use a Type-50 Sniper Rifle. If he wasn’t training and wasn’t out on missions, he was with his brother Mruko.\n</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; One day Alei and Mruko were sent on a mission to installation 05 to survey a Covenant fleet stationed at a forerunner structure. They were to infiltrate the structure and figure out what the prophet wanted with the facility. If the structure was important they were to try and destroy it, if this wasn’t an option they were to fall back to a DLZ and report to Rtas ‘Vadam.\n</div><div>July 25, 06:00, Installation 05, 2 klicks south of objective\n</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; The brothers were traveling along a small footpath that was supposed to lead to a plateau overlooking the target structure. They were carrying Energy Swords and Carbines along with charges to plant in case the building needed to be destroyed. After walking for several minutes the two finally set their sights on the forerunner structure.\n</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; The two moved silently along the cliff face keeping a lookout for stray kig-yar and unggoy. Once they were directly over the objective Alei indicated to Mruko for him to stay there. Alei then started to scale down the cliff making as little noise as possible only stepping on the firmest rocks available to avoid pebbles falling and causing attention. The constant noise from orders being given and dropships moving about helped conceal the little noise he did make.\n</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; Once at ground level Alei took cover behind some crates looking for a clear path to the entrance of the facility. Once he spotted one, he slowly moved from cover to cover until he was behind a lone elite standing guard at the entrance. In one swift movement Alei drew his sword and stabbed the unaware elite in the back, grabbing his face in the process to silence his inevitable scream. Once the elite was dead, he dragged the body into the brush to avoid raising alarms.\n</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; He then entered the facility being careful not to be spotted while sticking to the shadows. After continuing down multiple corridors for the next few minutes he came across what seemed to be a control room. Once he entered the room he saw a holographic map slowly spinning in the middle of the room, it was surrounded by forerunner runes and consoles that he didn’t recognize. He then notices a flashing icon on the middle of the map, the more he looked at it the more it seemed familiar. It was then he realized that it was an up-to-date map of the area the Fleet of Retribution was stationed.\n</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; Before thinking Alei took one of the charges and placed it on the major support in the middle of the room. He was no explosive expert but he know enough about architecture that he needed to place charges strategically along the major supports or week point within the structure. He ran towards the exit placing charges where he deemed it was weak. When he reaches the exit to the structure he places two charges on the door hoping to trap everyone inside then begins to climb the cliff.\n</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; Once at the top of the cliff next to his brother he took out a detonator and handed it to Mruko. At an unspoken command the two started running down the path they had come from. Once several Kilometers away from the facility Mruko blew the charges causing the structure to collapse along with a rockslide covering the majority of the structure. Even from the great distance they were from it the brothers still felt the ground shaking below them.\n</div><div>June 4, Earth, ONI Headquarters\n</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; Almost a week after the forerunner facility was destroyed Alei was asked to help Thel ‘Vadam at an ONI meeting discussing what would happen with the alliance after the war. Alei accepted the offer traveling with Thel to ONI’s headquarters on earth. \n</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; After the meeting Thel decided to stay at earth for a week to make sure everything was set properly. During the meeting Alei met the former member of Noble Team, Jun. After the meeting Alei asked Jun to teach him how to use a human sniper rifle, with experience as a marksman with covenant rifle he figured it wouldn’t take too long to master. Jun accepted and lead Alei to a courtyard with multiple courses and a firing range. \n</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; Once they were at the firing range Jun grabbed a couple of SRS99 AM Rifles and handed one to Alei. after a few basic lessons from Jun Alei got used to the recoil and firing mechanism, it was then that he could hit his marks similarly to how he had with a beam rifle. However he was not used to the bullet drop that occurs in a human rifle unlike the beam rifle. After multiple hours of training Alei thanked Jun and returned to his and Thel’s quarters where they were staying.\n</div><div>\n</div><div>August 28 20:00 Escala System, 5 klicks away from objective\n</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; Alei was assigned a small team of scouts including his brother Mruko. They were to do a recon mission with UNSC forces on a Rogue mercenary group that has been causing trouble with UNSC forces.\n</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; Alei and his team were walking down a small footpath in the cover of a forest about 1000 meters away from the rendezvous point when a rifle shot rang out through the forest. Alei and his scouts instinctively dropped to the ground readying their weapons. Alei signalled in the direction of the shot that they were friendly. A voice then came over the coms, that were given to Alei when accepting the mission, saying ”My apologize go ahead and advance.”\n</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; Alei and the rest of the Sangheili got up and slowly advanced through the forest. They reached a small clearing with five UNSC scouts standing in a semicircle with their weapons at the ready. Alei raised his hand indicating his men to stop and said, “relax we came to help.” He then turned to ask his brother a question but didn’t see him standing there. He frantically spun around hoping to see him standing somewhere else in the clearing but to no avail.\n</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; Alei, not seeing his brother in the clearing, starts to run as fast as he can to where they heard the sniper shot. Once there he saw his brother leaning against a rock gasping for breath. Alei kneels beside his brother lifting him into his arms. Mruko looks at Alei and whispers “I am sorry, my brother.” As the last of the light drains from Mruko’s eyes Alei looks to the stars and begins to yell for his brother.\n</div><div>The Sangheili scouts arrive behind Alei and drop to their knees. All is silent until Alei looks up and notices a group of warriors gathered around him. The leader, clad in all white, steps toward Alei and kneels before him. “I am sorry for your loss, I know your pain well… my name is Scorch, and these are my Hunters. We can help you take revenge on the ones responsible for your loss.”\n</div><div>Alei, now sitting on his knees, says, “I will accept as long as you promise me my brethren will not be harmed if they decide to leave, I leave that decision to them.” \n</div><div>“Everyone has their own hopes and wishes, I promise no one will be harmed if they decide to flee… Are you with me my brother?” \n</div><div>Scorch then offers his hand to the Sangheili. “My name is Alei, or Crossbow in your language. I am with you.” Alei then accepts help getting up from Scorch.\n</div><div>\n</div><div><br></div></div>\n            <hr class=\"line\" mbr-style=\"{'width': lineLength + '%'}\">\n        </div>\n    </div>\n</section>",

That dream is shattered. The Hunters are split, civil wars breaking out, orders being questioned. Loyalties breaking. But through the chaos, arose the true leaders. Not only did Scorch come back, stronger and ready to tear down hell but so did his true loyalist. Scorch, Griffen, Stream, Ceramic, and Lyrical. All skilled in different areas. But one mind set. The Hunters, and each other. A bond was made, they’d do whatever it took to foresee the Hunters survival. Even if it mean bloodshed of their own kin. Battles broke out, old allies, turned enemy. Slaughtered. Friends and family. Left for dead, The Hunters endure: it all. Watching friendships change, brotherhoods die. Bonds break. But one wouldn’t be allowed to break. Scorch made sure of it, until the faithful day, that almost brought the Hunters to an ending.\n</div><div>When they were forced to face old friends. After Sten Njal. Everyone questioned orders. Everyone who’d survived had to watch as their friends and family were broken, and slaughtered. One stood out, he’d questioned everything he’d fought for, once a loyalist, now a traitor. And scorch has to make an example, he sent three trained Hunters after this man, but when they got close. They were ambushed. The ex Hunter set a trap, and Scorch has fell for it. Hearing his men had been killed by this Hunter, he himself went, not looking to bring back this monster, but to end him. They met near a urban town at a bar. Scorch came unarmed. He knew he wouldn’t need anything but his fist, as he closed in on his target, he saw more Hunters around, those who left with this traitor. He spoke a clear sentence, in only a whisper but it sounded like thunder, “Only one man shall die tonight, leave.” And with that, the Hunters stepped closer, spatting insults and cursing Scorch’s name. They began to advance, until the traitor stepped forward, calling off his loyalist. “I shall slay this demon” was all that came out of his mouth, and then he charged and hit scorch, across the jaw, had he not been in armor, his jaw would of been snapped. But only did his head tilt a bit. With that, scorch grabbed the ex Hunters hand, bending it down in front of him, putting his boot on the elbow, and with his weight, pushed down. A visible snap. An audible rip of flesh. The Hunter screamed in pain, and backed away. Pulling out a magnum and shooting off shots.  Scorch evaded each shot, getting behind a nearby stall, he grabbed a knife, and charged, the Hunter saw the knife.\n</div><div>And took aim at Scorch’s head and started to pull the trigger when a loud boom rang out. Griffen, with her large rifle came through the front door, pushing aside civilians who were stupid enough to stay and watch the fights, shoving old Hunters away. She was followed by the honor guard; what was left of them. Lyrical behind her. Stream dropped in behind him. A shotgun ready, but he knew he wouldn’t need to use it. Griffen, approached the duo. And spoke clearly. “You May keep fighting, killing each other, breaking this family apart, or you can fight together, and fight against our enemies”. Ceramic dropped from the ceiling above, startling a few Hunters. And they went to draw their weapons but he had knifes to their throats before they could. Pinning each of them. Scorch took a step back, looking at the scared group, he didn’t dare glance at Griffen, but was stupid enough to, and he knew through her visor, she was glaring him down. Burning into his soul with her eyes. He took another step back, and took a long look at his opponent, struggling to stay up. But ready for a fight, he raised is hand straight in front of him. And said one word. “Forever.” The other Hunter glazed around, coughing, blood soaking through his cracked armor. He raised his good arm, grabbing Scorch’s wrist. “Forever” it was first Stream who took a knee. Laying aside his weapon, then Lyrical. Then the Hunters around them began. All taking a knee, looking straight down. “Forever.” Then Griffen did the same. Scorch took a look at his opponent. And took a knee, “Forever my brother.” The Hunter kneeled down supported by Scorch. “Forever my friend.”\n</div><div><br></div></div>\n            <hr class=\"line\" mbr-style=\"{'width': lineLength + '%'}\">\n        </div>\n    </div>\n</section>",
