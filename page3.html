            <div class="section-text align-center mbr-white mbr-fonts-style display-5"><div>Deaths Hunters, a groups of individuals brought together by a man whom had a dream. That dream is shattered. The Hunters are split, civil wars breaking out, orders being questioned. Loyalties breaking. But through the chaos, arose the true leaders. Not only did Scorch come back, stronger and ready to tear down hell but so did his true loyalist. Scorch, Griffen, Stream, Ceramic, and Lyrical. All skilled in different areas. But one mind set. The Hunters, and each other. A bond was made, they’d do whatever it took to foresee the Hunters survival. Even if it mean bloodshed of their own kin. Battles broke out, old allies, turned enemy. Slaughtered. Friends and family. Left for dead, The Hunters endure: it all. Watching friendships change, brotherhoods die. Bonds break. But one wouldn’t be allowed to break. Scorch made sure of it, until the faithful day, that almost brought the Hunters to an ending.
</div><div>When they were forced to face old friends. After Sten Njal. Everyone questioned orders. Everyone who’d survived had to watch as their friends and family were broken, and slaughtered. One stood out, he’d questioned everything he’d fought for, once a loyalist, now a traitor. And scorch has to make an example, he sent three trained Hunters after this man, but when they got close. They were ambushed. The ex Hunter set a trap, and Scorch has fell for it. Hearing his men had been killed by this Hunter, he himself went, not looking to bring back this monster, but to end him. They met near a urban town at a bar. Scorch came unarmed. He knew he wouldn’t need anything but his fist, as he closed in on his target, he saw more Hunters around, those who left with this traitor. He spoke a clear sentence, in only a whisper but it sounded like thunder, “Only one man shall die tonight, leave.” And with that, the Hunters stepped closer, spatting insults and cursing Scorch’s name. They began to advance, until the traitor stepped forward, calling off his loyalist. “I shall slay this demon” was all that came out of his mouth, and then he charged and hit scorch, across the jaw, had he not been in armor, his jaw would of been snapped. But only did his head tilt a bit. With that, scorch grabbed the ex Hunters hand, bending it down in front of him, putting his boot on the elbow, and with his weight, pushed down. A visible snap. An audible rip of flesh. The Hunter screamed in pain, and backed away. Pulling out a magnum and shooting off shots.  Scorch evaded each shot, getting behind a nearby stall, he grabbed a knife, and charged, the Hunter saw the knife.
</div><div>And took aim at Scorch’s head and started to pull the trigger when a loud boom rang out. Griffen, with her large rifle came through the front door, pushing aside civilians who were stupid enough to stay and watch the fights, shoving old Hunters away. She was followed by the honor guard; what was left of them. Lyrical behind her. Stream dropped in behind him. A shotgun ready, but he knew he wouldn’t need to use it. Griffen, approached the duo. And spoke clearly. “You May keep fighting, killing each other, breaking this family apart, or you can fight together, and fight against our enemies”. Ceramic dropped from the ceiling above, startling a few Hunters. And they went to draw their weapons but he had knifes to their throats before they could. Pinning each of them. Scorch took a step back, looking at the scared group, he didn’t dare glance at Griffen, but was stupid enough to, and he knew through her visor, she was glaring him down. Burning into his soul with her eyes. He took another step back, and took a long look at his opponent, struggling to stay up. But ready for a fight, he raised is hand straight in front of him. And said one word. “Forever.” The other Hunter glazed around, coughing, blood soaking through his cracked armor. He raised his good arm, grabbing Scorch’s wrist. “Forever” it was first Stream who took a knee. Laying aside his weapon, then Lyrical. Then the Hunters around them began. All taking a knee, looking straight down. “Forever.” Then Griffen did the same. Scorch took a look at his opponent. And took a knee, “Forever my brother.” The Hunter kneeled down supported by Scorch. “Forever my friend.”
